\section{Introduction}

The goal of this first assignment was to implement an Iterative Improvement
algorithm and a Variable Neighbourhood Descent algorithm. Multiple rules were
implemented for each algorithm in order to test their efficiency. For each
matrix instance we were given, we also have the best-known score we should try
to approach. For each combination of rules, we also had to run the 2 programs
on each instance. The results of each combination were used to compute
statistical tests with R.
