\section{Compilation \& scripts}

\noindent In order to compile the programs, cmake is necessary and the instructions below
must be followed.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
> mkdir out
> cd out
> cmake ..
> make lop vnd
\end{lstlisting}
\

\noindent As for the scripts, they can be run in the following order:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
> cd scripts
> ./generate_experiments.lua
> mv ../out/experiments ..
> ./compute_average.lua
> ./statistical_hypothesis_tests.R
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{framehint}
    \textbf{N.B.} Scripts and algorithms combinations not using the \emph{transpose}
    neighbourhood should be ran from the \emph{oldNeighbourhoods} branch
    (\emph{git checkout oldNeighbourhoods}) in order to be executed in feasible
    times. This branch contains the \emph{transpose} neighbourhood and 2 other
    neighbourhoods which are not the \emph{exchange} nor the \emph{insert}
    neighbourhoods even though they are called this way.
    The reason for this branch existence is related to problems regarding
    computation time which were encountered. These problems will be described
    later in this report.
